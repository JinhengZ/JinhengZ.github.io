                        This project is developed to assist users in enhancing their lung capacity and breathing
                        techniques. Utilizing advanced Virtual Reality (VR) technology, it tracks the speed and strength
                        of the user's breath. The system employs a sophisticated breathing model display that guides
                        users in adjusting their breathing pattern to achieve optimal performance. A visual feedback
                        mechanism is integrated into the program, where a green bubble indicates successful breathing
                        techniques, while a red bubble suggests the need for further practice and improvement.
